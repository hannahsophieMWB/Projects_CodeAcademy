The coding samples I provided were part of my Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist Career Path by Codecademy, where I worked on various projects to develop my skills in different machine learning techniques. These projects allowed me to explore and apply fraud detection algorithms, predict outcomes in tennis based on player habits, and build a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier for breast cancer prediction. These hands-on experiences helped me gain proficiency in machine learning concepts and techniques, enhancing my ability to tackle real-world problems through data analysis and modeling.
